    - Highest-Performing Schools by Overall Percent Passing
    - Lowest-Performing Schools by Overall Percent Passing
    - Math Scores by Grade
    - Reading Scores by Grade
    - Scores by School Spending
    - Scores by School Size
    - Scores by School Type

Assistance was gathered from AskBCS with creating a list of school types:

    - school_types = school_data.set_index('school_name')['type']
